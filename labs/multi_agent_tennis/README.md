# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

![Trained Agent](imgs/tennis.gif)

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation.  Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping. 

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those **scores** is at least +0.5.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Unzip (or decompress) the file in the current folder. 

Save the path to the environment as it will be required in the notebook.

## Development setup

To run all the code available in this repo you need to install the following software:

* Python = 3.6 (other versions lead to compatibility issue)
* [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) â‰¥ 1.0

### Poetry installation
To install and configure `poetry` run 
```shell script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python3
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

## Installation

First, to install all the required dependencies run
```shell script
poetry install
```

### Instructions

Follow the solution notebook for the [Tennis](Tennis.ipynb) environment to see how the agent was 
trained. To visualize how the trained agent behaves open the [Visualization](Visualization.ipynb) notebook

### Model

To solve the Tennis environment we implemented the MADDPG algorithm. MADDPG is an extension of the DDPG
algorithm to a multi-agent cooperative-competitive scenario. Moreover, the single DDPG agent can be 
seen as an extension to continous domains of the DQN approach proposed by DeepMind. This model is 
based on an *Actor-Critic* approach

In our case the Actor and the Critic of the two agents are implemented with the following networks
